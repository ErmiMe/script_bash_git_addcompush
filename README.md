Bash script that combines [git add . + git commit + git push] with prompt on terminal itself.
Warning 1: Unfortunately, since commit message is input on terminal instead of the VI interface, it wont show 50 character warning colors for the commit subject line.
Warning 2: Pressing ENTER will complete the message on terminal, it won't take you to a new line.
