Bash script that combines [git add . + git commit + git push] with prompt on terminal itself.
Warning 1: Unfortunately, since commit message is input on terminal, it wont show 50 character warning colors.
Warning 2: Pressing ENTER will complete the message on terminal. So if you want to go to a new line, you'll have to use the newline escape character instead.
